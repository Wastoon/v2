title: Predictive Discretization during Model Selection
abstract: We present an approach to discretizing multivariate continuous data while
  learning the structure of a graphical model. We derive the joint scoring function
  from the principle of predictive accuracy, which inherently ensures the optimal
  trade-off between goodness of fit and model complexity (including the number of
  discretization levels). Using the so-called finest grid implied by the data, our
  scoring function depends only on the number of data points in the various discretization
  levels. Not only can it be computed efficiently, but it is also invariant under
  monotonic transformations of the continuous space. Our experiments show that the
  discretization method can substantially impact the resulting graph structure.
