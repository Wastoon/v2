title: Kernel Multi-task Learning using Task-specific Features
abstract: 'In this paper we are concerned with multitask learning when task-specific
  features are available. We describe two ways of achieving this using Gaussian process
  predictors: in the first method, the data from all tasks is combined into one dataset,
  making use of the task-specific features. In the second method we train specific
  predictors for each reference task, and then combine their predictions using a gating
  network. We demonstrate these methods on a compiler performance prediction problem,
  where a task is defined as predicting the speed-up obtained when applying a sequence
  of code transformations to a given program.'
