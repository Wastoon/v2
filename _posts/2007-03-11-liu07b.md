title: Fisher Consistency of Multicategory Support Vector Machines
abstract: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) has become one of the most popular machine
  learning techniques in recent years. The success of the SVM is mostly due to its
  elegant margin concept and theory in binary classification. Generalization to the
  multicategory setting, however, is not trivial. There are a number of different
  multicategory extensions of the SVM in the literature. In this paper, we review
  several commonly used extensions and Fisher consistency of these extensions. For
  inconsistent extensions, we propose two approaches to make them Fisher consistent,
  one is to add bounded constraints and the other is to truncate unbounded hinge losses.
