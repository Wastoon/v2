title: Inductive Transfer for Bayesian Network Structure Learning
abstract: We consider the problem of learning Bayes Net structures for related tasks.
  We present an algorithm for learning Bayes Net structures that takes advantage of
  the similarity between tasks by biasing learning toward similar structures for each
  task. Heuristic search is used to find a high scoring set of structures (one for
  each task), where the score for a set of structures is computed in a principled
  way. Experiments on problems generated from the ALARM and INSURANCE networks show
  that learning the structures for related tasks using the proposed method yields
  better results than learning the structures independently.
