title: Learning a Nonlinear Embedding by Preserving Class Neighbourhood Structure
abstract: We show how to pretrain and fine-tune a multilayer neural network to learn
  a nonlinear transformation from the input space to a lowdimensional feature space
  in which K-nearest neighbour classification performs well. We also show how the
  non-linear transformation can be improved using unlabeled data. Our method achieves
  a much lower error rate than Support Vector Machines or standard backpropagation
  on a widely used version of the MNIST handwritten digit recognition task. If some
  of the dimensions of the low-dimensional feature space are not used for nearest
  neighbor classification, our method uses these dimensions to explicitly represent
  transformations of the digits that do not affect their identity.
