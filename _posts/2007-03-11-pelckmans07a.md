title: Margin based Transductive Graph Cuts using Linear Programming
abstract: This paper studies the problem of inferring a partition (or a graph cut)
  of an undirected deterministic graph where the labels of some nodes are observed
  - thereby bridging a gap between graph theory and probabilistic inference techniques.
  Given a weighted graph, we focus on the rules of weighted neighbors to predict the
  label of a particular node. A maximum margin and maximal average margin based argument
  is used to prove a generalization bound, and is subsequently related to the classical
  MINCUT approach. From a practical perspective a simple and intuitive, but efficient
  convex formulation is constructed. This scheme can readily be implemented as a linear
  program which scales well till a few thousands of (labeled or unlabeled) data-points.
  The extremal case is studied where one observes only a single label, and this setting
  is related to the task of unsupervised clustering.
