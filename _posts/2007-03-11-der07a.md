title: Large-Margin Classification in Banach Spaces
abstract: We propose a framework for dealing with binary hard-margin classification
  in Banach spaces, centering on the use of a supporting semi-inner-product (s.i.p.)
  taking the place of an inner-product in Hilbert spaces. The theory of semi-inner-product
  spaces allows for a geometric, Hilbert-like formulation of the problems, and we
  show that a surprising number of results from the Euclidean case can be appropriately
  generalised. These include the Representer theorem, convexity of the associated
  optimization programs, and even, for a particular class of Banach spaces, a ``kernel
  trick'' for non-linear classification.
