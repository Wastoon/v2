title: Solving Markov Random Fields with Spectral Relaxation
abstract: Markov Random Fields (MRFs) are used in a large array of computer vision
  and maching learning applications. Finding the Maximum Aposteriori (MAP) solution
  of an MRF is in general intractable, and one has to resort to approximate solutions,
  such as Belief Propagation, Graph Cuts, or more recently, approaches based on quadratic
  programming. We propose a novel type of approximation, Spectral relaxation to Quadratic
  Programming (SQP). We show our method offers tighter bounds than recently published
  work, while at the same time being computationally efficient. We compare our method
  to other algorithms on random MRFs in various settings.
