title: Efficient large margin semisupervised learning
abstract: 'In classification, semisupervised learning involves a large amount of unlabeled
  data with only a small number of labeled data. This imposes great challenge in that
  the class probability given input can not be well estimated through labeled data
  alone. To enhance predictability of classification, this article introduces a large
  margin semisupervised learning method constructing an efficient loss to measure
  the contribution of unlabeled instances to classification. The loss is iteratively
  refined, based on which an iterative scheme is derived for implementation. The proposed
  method is examined for two large margin classifiers: support vector machines and  Ïˆ-learning.
  Our theoretical and numerical analyses indicate that the method achieves the desired
  objective of delivering higher performances over any other method initializing the
  scheme.'
