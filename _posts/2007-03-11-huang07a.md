title: Loopy Belief Propagation for Bipartite Maximum Weight b-Matching
abstract: We formulate the weighted b-matching objective function as a probability
  distribution function and prove that belief propagation (BP) on its graphical model
  converges to the optimum. Standard BP on our graphical model cannot be computed
  in polynomial time, but we introduce an algebraic method to circumvent the combinatorial
  message updates. Empirically, the resulting algorithm is on average faster than
  popular combinatorial implementations, while still scaling at the same asymptotic
  rate of $O(bn^3)$. Furthermore, the algorithm shows promising performance in machine
  learning applications.
