title: Performance Guarantees for Information Theoretic Active Inference
abstract: In many estimation problems, the measurement process can be actively controlled
  to alter the information received. The control choices made in turn determine the
  performance that is possible in the underlying inference task. In this paper, we
  discuss performance guarantees for heuristic algorithms for adaptive measurement
  selection in sequential estimation problems, where the inference criterion is mutual
  information. We also demonstrate the performance of our tighter online computable
  performance guarantees through computational simulations.
