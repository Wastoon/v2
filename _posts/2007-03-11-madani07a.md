title: 'Recall Systems: Effcient Learning and Use of Category Indices'
abstract: We introduce the framework of recall systems for efficient learning and
  retrieval of categories when the number of categories is large. A recallsystem here
  is a simple feature-based intermediate filtering step which reduces the potential
  categories for an instance to a small manageable set. The correct categories from
  this set can then be determined using traditional classifiers. We present a formalization
  of the index learning problem and establish NP-hardness and approximation hardness.
  We proceed to give an efficient heuristic for learning indices, and evaluate it
  on several large data sets. In our experiments, the index is learned within minutes,
  and reduces the number of categories by several orders of magnitude, without affecting
  the quality of classification overall.
