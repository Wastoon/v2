title: Fast Kernel ICA using an Approximate Newton Method
abstract: Recent approaches to independent component analysis (ICA) have used kernel
  independence measures to obtain very good performance, particularly where classical
  methods experience difficulty (for instance, sources with near-zero kurtosis). We
  present fast kernel ICA (FastKICA), a novel optimisation technique for one such
  kernel independence measure, the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC).
  Our search procedure uses an approximate Newton method on the special orthogonal
  group, where we estimate the Hessian locally about independence. We employ incomplete
  Cholesky decomposition to efficiently compute the gradient and approximate Hessian.
  FastKICA results in more accurate solutions at a given cost compared with gradient
  descent, and is relatively insensitive to local minima when initialised far from
  independence. These properties allow kernel approaches to be extended to problems
  with larger numbers of sources and observations. Our method is competitive with
  other modern and classical ICA approaches in both speed and accuracy.
