title: Generalized Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling
abstract: 'We consider the non-metric multidimensional scaling problem: given a set
  of dissimilarities ∆, find an embedding whose inter-point Euclidean distances have
  the same ordering as ∆. In this paper, we look at a generalization of this problem
  in which only a set of order relations of the form d_ij < d_kl are provided. Unlike
  the original problem, these order relations can be contradictory and need not be
  specified for all pairs of dissimilarities. We argue that this setting is more natural
  in some experimental settings and propose an algorithm based on convex optimization
  techniques to solve this problem. We apply this algorithm to human subject data
  from a psychophysics experiment concerning how reflectance properties are perceived.
  We also look at the standard NMDS problem, where a dissimilarity matrix ∆is provided
  as input, and show that we can always find an orderrespecting embedding of ∆.'
