title: Generalized Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling
abstract: 'We consider the non-metric multidimensional scaling problem: given a set
  of dissimilarities $\Delta$, find an embedding whose inter-point Euclidean distances
  have the same ordering as $\Delta$. In this paper, we look at a generalization of
  this problem in which only a set of order relations of the form $d_{ij} < d_{kl}$
  are provided. Unlike the original problem, these order relations can be contradictory
  and need not be specified for all pairs of dissimilarities. We argue that this setting
  is more natural in some experimental settings and propose an algorithm based on
  convex optimization techniques to solve this problem. We apply this algorithm to
  human subject data from a psychophysics experiment concerning how reflectance properties
  are perceived. We also look at the standard NMDS problem, where a dissimilarity
  matrix $\Delta$ is provided as input, and show that we can always find an orderrespecting
  embedding of $\Delta$.'
