title: Space-Efficient Sampling
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating nonparametric probability density
  functions from a sequence of independent samples. The central issue that we address
  is to what extent this can be achieved with only limited memory. Our main result
  is a space-efficient learning algorithm for determining the probability density
  function of a piecewise-linear distribution. However, the primary goal of this paper
  is to demonstrate the utility of various techniques from the burgeoning field of
  data stream processing in the context of learning algorithms.
