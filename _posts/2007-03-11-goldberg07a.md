title: Dissimilarity in Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Classification
abstract: Label dissimilarity specifies that a pair of examples probably have different
  class labels. We present a semi-supervised classification algorithm that learns
  from dissimilarity and similarity information on labeled and unlabeled data. Our
  approach uses a novel graphbased encoding of dissimilarity that results in a convex
  problem, and can handle both binary and multiclass classification. Experiments on
  several tasks are promising.
