title: Maximum Entropy Correlated Equilibria
abstract: We study maximum entropy correlated equilibria (Maxent CE) in multi-player
  games. After motivating and deriving some interesting important properties of Maxent
  CE, we provide two gradient-based algorithms that are guaranteed to converge to
  it. The proposed algorithms have strong connections to algorithms for statistical
  estimation (e.g., iterative scaling), and permit a distributed learning-dynamics
  interpretation. We also briefly discuss possible connections of this work, and more
  generally of the Maximum Entropy Principle in statistics, to the work on learning
  in games and the problem of equilibrium selection.
