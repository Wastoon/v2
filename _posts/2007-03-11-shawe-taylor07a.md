title: A Framework for Probability Density Estimation
abstract: The paper introduces a new framework for learning probability density functions.
  A theoretical analysis suggests that we can tailor a distribution for a class of
  tasks by training it to fit a small subsample. Experimental evidence is given to
  support the theoretical analysis.
