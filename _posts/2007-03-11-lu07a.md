title: 'Semi-supervised Clustering with Pairwise Constraints: A Discriminative Approach'
abstract: We consider the semi-supervised clustering problem where we know (with varying
  degree of certainty) that some sample pairs are (or are not) in the same class.
  Unlike previous efforts in adapting clustering algorithms to incorporate those pairwise
  relations, our work is based on a discriminative model. We generalize the standard
  Gaussian process classifier (GPC) to express our classification preference. To use
  the samples not involved in pairwise relations, we employ the graph kernels (covariance
  matrix) based on the entire data set. Experiments on a variety of data sets show
  that our algorithm significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.
