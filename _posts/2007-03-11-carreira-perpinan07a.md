title: The Laplacian Eigenmaps Latent Variable Model
abstract: We introduce the Laplacian Eigenmaps Latent Variable Model (LELVM), a probabilistic
  method for nonlinear dimensionality reduction that combines the advantages of spectral
  methods–global optimisation and ability to learn convoluted manifolds of high intrinsic
  dimensionality–with those of latent variable models–dimensionality reduction and
  reconstruction mappings and a density model. We derive LELVM by defining a natural
  out-of-sample mapping for Laplacian eigenmaps using a semi-supervised learning argument.
  LELVM is simple, nonparametric and computationally not very costly, and is shown
  to perform well with motion-capture data.
