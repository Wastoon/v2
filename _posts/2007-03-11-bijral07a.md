title: 'Mixture of Watson Distributions: A Generative Model for Hyperspherical Embeddings'
abstract: Machine learning applications often involve data that can be analyzed as
  unit vectors on a d-dimensional hypersphere, or equivalently are directional in
  nature. Spectral clustering techniques generate embeddings that constitute an example
  of directional data and can result in different shapes on a hypersphere (depending
  on the original structure). Other examples of directional data include text and
  some sub-domains of bioinformatics. The Watson distribution for directional data
  presents a tractable form and has more modeling capability than the simple von Mises-Fisher
  distribution. In this paper, we present a generative model of mixtures of Watson
  distributions on a hypersphere and derive numerical approximations of the parameters
  in an Expectation Maximization (EM) setting. This model also allows us to present
  an explanation for choosing the right embedding dimension for spectral clustering.
  We analyze the algorithm on a generated example and demonstrate its superiority
  over the existing algorithms through results on real datasets.
