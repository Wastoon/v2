title: Visualizing Similarity Data with a Mixture of Maps
abstract: We show how to visualize a set of pairwise similarities between objects
  by using several different two-dimensional maps, each of which captures different
  aspects of the similarity structure. When the objects are ambiguous words, for example,
  different senses of a word occur in different maps, so ``river'' and ``loan'' can
  both be close to ``bank'' without being at all close to each other. Aspect maps
  resemble clustering because they model pair-wise similarities as a mixture of different
  types of similarity, but they also resemble local multi-dimensional scaling because
  they model each type of similarity by a twodimensional map. We demonstrate our method
  on a toy example, a database of human wordassociation data, a large set of images
  of handwritten digits, and a set of feature vectors that represent words.
