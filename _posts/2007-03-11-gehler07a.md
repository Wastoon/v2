title: Deterministic Annealing for Multiple-Instance Learning
abstract: In this paper we demonstrate how deterministic annealing can be applied
  to different SVM formulations of the multiple-instance learning (MIL) problem. Our
  results show that we find better local minima compared to the heuristic methods
  those problems are usually solved with. However this does not always translate into
  a better test error suggesting an inadequacy of the objective function. Based on
  this finding we propose a new objective function which together with the deterministic
  annealing algorithm finds better local minima and achieves better performance on
  a set of benchmark datasets. Furthermore the results also show how the structure
  of MIL datasets influence the performance of MIL algorithms and we discuss how future
  benchmark datasets for the MIL problem should be designed.
