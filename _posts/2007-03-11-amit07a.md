title: A Boosting Algorithm for Label Covering in Multilabel Problems
abstract: We describe, analyze and experiment with a boosting algorithm for multilabel
  categorization problems. Our algorithm includes as special cases previously studied
  boosting algorithms such as Adaboost.MH. We cast the multilabel problem as multiple
  binary decision problems, based on a user-defined covering of the set of labels.
  We prove a lower bound on the progress made by our algorithm on each boosting iteration
  and demonstrate the merits of our algorithm in experiments with text categorization
  problems.
