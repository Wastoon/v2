title: Information Retrieval by Inferring Implicit Queries from Eye Movements
abstract: We introduce a new search strategy, in which the information retrieval (IR)
  query is inferred from eye movements measured when the user is reading text during
  an IR task. In training phase, we know the users’ interest, that is, the relevance
  of training documents. We learn a predictor that produces a “query” given the eye
  movements; the target of learning is an “optimal” query that is computed based on
  the known relevance of the training documents. Assuming the predictor is universal
  with respect to the users’ interests, it can also be applied to infer the implicit
  query when we have no prior knowledge of the users’ interests. The result of an
  empirical study is that it is possible to learn the implicit query from a small
  set of read documents, such that relevance predictions for a large set of unseen
  documents are ranked significantly better than by random guessing.
