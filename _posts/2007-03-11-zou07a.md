title: An Improved 1-norm SVM for Simultaneous Classification and Variable Selection
abstract: We propose a novel extension of the 1-norm support vector machine (SVM)
  for simultaneous feature selection and classification. The new algorithm penalizes
  the empirical hinge loss by the adaptively weighted 1-norm penalty in which the
  weights are computed by the 2-norm SVM. Hence the new algorithm is called the hybrid
  SVM. Simulation and real data examples show that the hybrid SVM not only often improves
  upon the 1-norm SVM in terms of classification accuracy but also enjoys better feature
  selection performance.
