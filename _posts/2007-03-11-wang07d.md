title: Fast Mean Shift with Accurate and Stable Convergence
abstract: Mean shift is a powerful but computationally expensive method for nonparametric
  clustering and optimization. It iteratively moves each data point to its local mean
  until convergence. We introduce a fast algorithm for computing mean shift based
  on the dual-tree. Unlike previous speed-up attempts, our algorithm maintains a relative
  error bound at each iteration, resulting in significantly more stable and accurate
  convergence. We demonstrate the benefit of our method in clustering experiments
  with real and synthetic data.
