title: Minimum Volume Embedding
abstract: Minimum Volume Embedding (MVE) is an algorithm for non-linear dimensionality
  reduction that uses semidefinite programming (SDP) and matrix factorization to find
  a low-dimensional embedding that preserves local distances between points while
  representing the dataset in many fewer dimensions. MVE follows an approach similar
  to algorithms such as Semidefinite Embedding (SDE), in that it learns a kernel matrix
  using an SDP before applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). However,
  the objective function for MVE directly optimizes the eigenspectrum of the data
  to preserve as much of its energy as possible within the few dimensions available
  to the embedding. Simultaneously, remaining eigenspectrum energy is minimized in
  directions orthogonal to the embedding thereby keeping data in a so-called minimum
  volume manifold. We show how MVE improves upon SDE in terms of the volume of the
  preserved embedding and the resulting eigenspectrum, producing better visualizations
  for a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, including simple toy examples,
  face images, handwritten digits, phylogenetic trees, and social networks.
