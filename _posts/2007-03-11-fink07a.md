title: Online Learning of Search Heuristics
abstract: In this paper we learn heuristic functions that efficiently find the shortest
  path between two nodes in a graph. We rely on the fact that often, several elementary
  admissible heuristics might be provided, either by human designers or from formal
  domain abstractions. These simple heuristics are traditionally composed into a new
  admissible heuristic by selecting the highest scoring elementary heuristic in each
  distance evaluation. We suggest that learning a weighted sum over the elementary
  heuristics can often generate a heuristic with higher dominance than the heuristic
  defined by the highest score selection. The weights within our composite heuristic
  are trained in an online manner using nodes to which the true distance has already
  been revealed during previous search stages. Several experiments demonstrate that
  the proposed method typically finds the optimal path while significantly reducing
  the search complexity. Our theoretical analysis describes conditions under which
  finding the shortest path can be guaranteed.
