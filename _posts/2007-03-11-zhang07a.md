title: Generalized Do-Calculus with Testable Causal Assumptions
abstract: A primary object of causal reasoning concerns what would happen to a system
  under certain interventions. Specifically, we are often interested in estimating
  the probability distribution of some random variables that would result from forcing
  some other variables to take certain values. The renowned do-calculus (Pearl 1995)
  gives a set of rules that govern the identification of such post-intervention probabilities
  in terms of (estimable) pre-intervention probabilities, assuming available a directed
  acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the underlying causal structure. However, a
  DAG causal structure is seldom fully testable given preintervention, observational
  data, since many competing DAG structures are equally compatible with the data.
  In this paper we extend the do-calculus to cover cases where the available causal
  information is summarized in a so-called partial ancestral graph (PAG) that represents
  an equivalence class of DAG structures. The causal assumptions encoded by a PAG
  are significantly weaker than those encoded by a full-blown DAG causal structure,
  and are in principle fully testable by observed conditional independence relations.
