title: A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach to Modeling Overlapping Clusters
abstract: Although clustering data into mutually exclusive partitions has been an
  extremely successful approach to unsupervised learning, there are many situations
  in which a richer model is needed to fully represent the data.  This is the case
  in problems where data points actually simultaneously belong to multiple, overlapping
  clusters. For example a particular gene may have several functions, therefore belonging
  to several distinct clusters of genes, and a biologist may want to discover these
  through unsupervised modeling of gene expression data. We present a new nonparametric
  Bayesian method, the Infinite Overlapping Mixture Model (IOMM), for modeling overlapping
  clusters. The IOMM uses exponential family distributions to model each cluster and
  forms an overlapping mixture by taking products of such distributions, much like
  products of experts (Hinton, 2002). The IOMM allows an unbounded number of clusters,
  and assignments of points to (multiple) clusters is modeled using an Indian Buffet
  Process (IBP), (Griffiths and Ghahramani, 2006). The IOMM has the desirable properties
  of being able to focus in on overlapping regions while maintaining the ability to
  model a potentially infinite number of clusters which may overlap. We derive MCMC
  inference algorithms for the IOMM and show that these can be used to cluster movies
  into multiple genres.
