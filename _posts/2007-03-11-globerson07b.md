title: Visualizing pairwise similarity via semidefinite programming
abstract: We introduce a novel learning algorithm for binary pairwise similarity measurements
  on a set of objects. The algorithm delivers an embedding of the objects into a vector
  representation space that strictly respects the known similarities, in the sense
  that objects known to be similar are always closer in the embedding than those known
  to be dissimilar. Subject to this constraint, our method selects the mapping in
  which the variance of the embedded points is maximized. This has the effect of favoring
  embeddings with low effective dimensionality. The related optimization problem can
  be cast as a convex Semidefinite Program (SDP). We also present a parametric version
  of the problem, which can be used for embedding out of sample points. The parametric
  version uses kernels to obtain nonlinear maps, and can also be solved using an SDP.
  We apply the two algorithms to an image embedding problem, where it effectively
  captures the low dimensional structure corresponding to camera viewing parameters.
