title: 'SampleSearch: A Scheme that Searches for Consistent Samples'
abstract: Sampling from belief networks which have a substantial number of zero probabilities
  is problematic. MCMC algorithms like Gibbs sampling do not converge and importance
  sampling schemes generate many zero weight samples that are rejected, yielding an
  inefficient sampling process (the rejection problem). In this paper, we propose
  to augment importance sampling with systematic constraint-satisfaction search in
  order to overcome the rejection problem. The resulting SampleSearch scheme can be
  made unbiased by using a computationally expensive weighting scheme. To overcome
  this an approximation is proposed such that the resulting estimator is asymptotically
  unbiased. Our empirical results demonstrate the potential of our new scheme.
