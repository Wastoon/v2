title: The Kernel Path in Kernelized LASSO
abstract: Kernel methods implicitly map data points from the input space to some feature
  space where even relatively simple algorithms such as linear methods can deliver
  very impressive performance. Of crucial importance though is the choice of the kernel
  function, which determines the mapping between the input space and the feature space.
  The past few years have seen many efforts in learning either the kernel function
  or the kernel matrix. In this paper, we study the problem of learning the kernel
  hyperparameter in the context of the kernelized LASSO regression model. Specifically,
  we propose a solution path algorithm with respect to the hyperparameter of the kernel
  function. As the kernel hyperparameter changes its value, the solution path can
  be traced exactly without having to train the model multiple times. As a result,
  the optimal solution can be identified efficiently. Some simulation results will
  be presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed kernel path algorithm.
