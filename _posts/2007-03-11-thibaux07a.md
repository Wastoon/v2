title: Hierarchical Beta Processes and the Indian Buffet Process
abstract: We show that the beta process is the de Finetti mixing distribution underlying
  the Indian buffet process of [2]. This result shows that the beta process plays
  the role for the Indian buffet process that the Dirichlet process plays for the
  Chinese restaurant process, a parallel that guides us in deriving analogs for the
  beta process of the many known extensions of the Dirichlet process. In particular
  we define Bayesian hierarchies of beta processes and use the connection to the beta
  process to develop posterior inference algorithms for the Indian buffet process.
  We also present an application to document classification, exploring a relationship
  between the hierarchical beta process and smoothed naive Bayes models.
