title: Importance Sampling for General Hybrid Bayesian Networks
abstract: Some real problems are more naturally modeled by hybrid Bayesian networks
  that consist of mixtures of continuous and discrete variables with their interactions
  described by equations and continuous probability distributions. However, inference
  in such general hybrid models is hard. Therefore, existing approaches either only
  deal with special instances, such as Conditional Linear Gaussians (CLGs), or approximate
  a general model with a restricted version and then perform inference on the simpler
  model. However, results thus obtained highly depend on the quality of the approximations.
  This paper describes an importance sampling-based algorithm that directly deals
  with hybrid Bayesian networks constructed in the most general settings and guarantees
  to converge to the correct answers given enough time.
