title: Semi-Supervised Mean Fields
abstract: A novel semi-supervised learning approach based on statistical physics is
  proposed in this paper. We treat each data point as an Ising spin and the interaction
  between pairwise spins is captured by the similarity between the pairwise points.
  The labels of the data points are treated as the directions of the corresponding
  spins. In semi-supervised setting, some of the spins have fixed directions (which
  corresponds to the labeled data), and our task is to determine the directions of
  other spins. An approach based on the Mean Field theory is proposed to achieve this
  goal. Finally the experimental results on both toy and real world data sets are
  provided to show the effectiveness of our method.
