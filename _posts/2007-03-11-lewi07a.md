title: Efficient active learning with generalized linear models
abstract: "Active learning can significantly reduce the amount of training data required
  to fit parametric statistical models for supervised learning tasks. Here we present
  an efficient algorithm for choosing the optimal (most informative) query when the
  output labels are related to the inputs by a generalized linear model (GLM). The
  algorithm is based on a Laplace approximation of the posterior distribution of the
  GLMÂ\x92s parameters. The algorithm requires only low-rank matrix manipulations
  and a single two-dimensional search to choose the optimal query and has complexity
  O(n^2) (with n the dimension of the feature space), making active learning with
  GLMs feasible even for high-dimensional feature spaces. In certain cases the twodimensional
  search may be reduced to a onedimensional search, further improving the algorithmÂ\x92s
  efficiency. Simulation results show that the model parameters can be estimated much
  more efficiently using the active learning technique than by using randomly chosen
  queries. We compute the asymptotic posterior covariance semi-analytically and demonstrate
  that the algorithm empirically achieves this asymptotic convergence rate, which
  is generally better than the convergence rate in the random-query setting. Finally,
  we generalize the approach to efficiently handle both output history effects (for
  applications to time-series models of autoregressive type) and slow, non-systematic
  drifts in the model parameters"
