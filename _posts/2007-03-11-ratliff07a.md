title: "(Approximate) Subgradient Methods for Structured Prediction"
abstract: Promising approaches to structured learning problems have recently been
  developed in the maximum margin framework. Unfortunately, algorithms that are computationally
  and memory efficient enough to solve large scale problems have lagged behind. We
  propose using simple subgradient-based techniques for optimizing a regularized risk
  formulation of these problems in both online and batch settings, and analyze the
  theoretical convergence, generalization, and robustness properties of the resulting
  techniques. These algorithms are are simple, memory efficient, fast to converge,
  and have small regret in the online setting. We also investigate a novel convex
  regression formulation of structured learning. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits
  of the subgradient approach on three structured prediction problems.
