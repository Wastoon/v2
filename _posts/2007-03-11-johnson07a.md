title: Learning Markov Structure by Maximum Entropy Relaxation
abstract: We propose a new approach for learning a sparse graphical model approximation
  to a specified multivariate probability distribution (such as the empirical distribution
  of sample data). The selection of sparse graph structure arises naturally in our
  approach through solution of a convex optimization problem, which differentiates
  our method from standard combinatorial approaches. We seek the maximum entropy relaxation
  (MER) within an exponential family, which maximizes entropy subject to constraints
  that marginal distributions on small subsets of variables are close to the prescribed
  marginals in relative entropy. To solve MER, we present a modified primal-dual interior
  point method that exploits sparsity of the Fisher information matrix in models defined
  on chordal graphs. This leads to a tractable, scalable approach provided the level
  of relaxation in MER is sufficient to obtain a thin graph. The merits of our approach
  are investigated by recovering the structure of some simple graphical models from
  sample data.
