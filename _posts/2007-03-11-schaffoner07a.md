title: Memory-Effcient Orthogonal Least Squares Kernel Density Estimation using Enhanced
  Empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions
abstract: A novel training algorithm for sparse kernel density estimates by regression
  of the empirical cumulative density function (ECDF) is presented. It is shown how
  an overdetermined linear least-squares problem may be solved by a greedy forward
  selection procedure using updates of the orthogonal decomposition in an order-recursive
  manner. We also present a method for improving the accuracy of the estimated models
  which uses output-sensitive computation of the ECDF. Experiments show the superior
  performance of our proposed method compared to stateof-the-art density estimation
  methods such as Parzen windows, Gaussian Mixture Models, and $\epsilon$-Support
  Vector Density models [1].
