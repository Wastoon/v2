title: Multi-object tracking with representations of the symmetric group
abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for approximately maintaining and updating
  a distribution over permutations matching tracks to real world objects. The algorithm
  hinges on two insights from the theory of harmonic analysis on noncommutative groups.
  The first is that most of the information in the distribution over permutations
  is captured by certain ``low frequency'' Fourier components. The second is that
  Bayesian updates of these components can be efficiently realized by extensions of
  Clausen's FFT for the symmetric group.
