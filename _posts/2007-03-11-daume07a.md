title: Fast search for Dirichlet process mixture models
abstract: 'Dirichlet process (DP) mixture models provide a flexible Bayesian framework
  for density estimation. Unfortunately, their flexibility comes at a cost: inference
  in DP mixture models is computationally expensive, even when conjugate distributions
  are used. In the common case when one seeks only a maximum a posteriori assignment
  of data points to clusters, we show that search algorithms provide a practical alternative
  to expensive MCMC and variational techniques. When a true posterior sample is desired,
  the solution found by search can serve as a good initializer for MCMC. Experimental
  results show that using these techniques is it possible to apply DP mixture models
  to very large data sets.'
