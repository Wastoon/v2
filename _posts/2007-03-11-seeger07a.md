title: Bayesian Inference and Optimal Design in the Sparse Linear Model
abstract: The sparse linear model has seen many successful applications in Statistics,
  Machine Learning, and Computational Biology, such as identification of gene regulatory
  networks from micro-array expression data. Prior work has either approximated Bayesian
  inference by expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo, or replaced it by point estimation.
  We show how to obtain a good approximation to Bayesian analysis efficiently, using
  the Expectation Propagation method. We also address the problems of optimal design
  and hyperparameter estimation. We demonstrate our framework on a gene network identification
  task.
