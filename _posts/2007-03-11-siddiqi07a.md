title: Fast State Discovery for HMM Model Selection and Learning
abstract: Choosing the number of hidden states and their topology (model selection)
  and estimating model parameters (learning) are important problems for Hidden Markov
  Models. This paper presents a new state-splitting algorithm that addresses both
  these problems. The algorithm models more information about the dynamic context
  of a state during a split, enabling it to discover underlying states more effectively.
  Compared to previous top-down methods, the algorithm also touches a smaller fraction
  of the data per split, leading to faster model search and selection. Because of
  its efficiency and ability to avoid local minima, the state-splitting approach is
  a good way to learn HMMs even if the desired number of states is known beforehand.
  We compare our approach to previous work on synthetic data as well as several real-world
  data sets from the literature, revealing significant improvements in efficiency
  and test-set likelihoods. We also compare to previous algorithms on a sign-language
  recognition task, with positive results.
