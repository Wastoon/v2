title: 'Learning A* underestimates : Using inference to guide inference'
abstract: We present a technique for speeding up inference of structured variables
  using a prioritydriven search algorithm rather than the more conventional dynamic
  programing. A priority-driven search algorithm is guaranteed to return the optimal
  answer if the priority function is an underestimate of the true cost function. We
  introduce the notion of a probable approximate underestimate, and show that it can
  be used to compute a probable approximate solution to the inference problem when
  used as a priority function. We show that we can learn probable approximate underestimate
  functions which have the functional form of simpler, easy to decode models. These
  models can be learned from unlabeled data by solving a linear/quadratic optimization
  problem. As a result, we get a priority function that can be computed quickly, and
  results in solutions that are (provably) almost optimal most of the time. Using
  these ideas, discriminative classifiers such as semi-Markov CRFs and discriminative
  parsers can be sped up using a generalization of the A* algorithm. Further, this
  technique resolves one of the biggest obstacles to the use of A* as a general decoding
  procedure, namely that of coming up with a admissible priority function. Applying
  this technique results in a algorithm that is more than 3 times as fast as the Viterbi
  algorithm for decoding semi-Markov Conditional Markov Models.
