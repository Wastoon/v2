title: The Rademacher Complexity of Co-Regularized Kernel Classes
abstract: In the multi-view approach to semisupervised learning, we choose one predictor
  from each of multiple hypothesis classes, and we “co-regularize” our choices by
  penalizing disagreement among the predictors on the unlabeled data. We examine the
  co-regularization method used in the coregularized least squares (CoRLS) algorithm
  [12], in which the views are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS’s), and the
  disagreement penalty is the average squared diffrence in predictions. The final
  predictor is the pointwise average of the predictors from each view. We call the
  set of predictors that can result from this procedure the co-regularized hypothesis
  class. Our main result is a tight bound on the Rademacher complexity of the co-regularized
  hypothesis class in terms of the kernel matrices of each RKHS. We find that the
  co-regularization reduces the Rademacher complexity by an amount that depends on
  the distance between the two views, as measured by a data dependent metric. We then
  use standard techniques to bound the gap between training error and test error for
  the CoRLS algorithm. Experimentally, we find that the amount of reduction in complexity
  introduced by co-regularization correlates with the amount of improvement that co-regularization
  gives in the CoRLS algorithm.
