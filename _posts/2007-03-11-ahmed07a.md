title: Seeking The Truly Correlated Topic Posterior - on tight approximate inference
  of logistic-normal admixture model
abstract: The Logistic-Normal Topic Admixture Model (LoNTAM), also known as correlated
  topic model (Blei and Lafferty, 2005), is a promising and expressive admixture-based
  text model. It can capture topic correlations via the use of a logistic-normal distribution
  to model non-trivial variabilities in the topic mixing vectors underlying documents.
  However, the non-conjugacy caused by the logistic-normal makes posterior inference
  and model learning significantly more challenging. In this paper, we present a new,
  tight approximate inference algorithm for LoNTAM based on a multivariate quadratic
  Taylor approximation scheme that facilitates elegant closed-form message passing.
  We present experimental results on simulated data as well as on the NIPS17 and PNAS
  document collections, and show that our approach is not only simple and easy to
  implement, but also it converges faster, and leads to more accurate recovery of
  the semantic truth underlying documents and estimates of the parameters comparing
  to previous methods.
