title: Nonnegative Garrote Component Selection in Functional ANOVA models
abstract: We consider the problem of component selection in a functional ANOVA model.
  A nonparametric extension of the nonnegative garrote (Breiman, 1996) is proposed.
  We show that the whole solution path of the proposed method can be efficiently computed,
  which, in turn , facilitates the selection of the tuning parameter. We also show
  that the final estimate enjoys nice theoretical properties given that the tuning
  parameter is appropriately chosen. Simulation and a real data example demonstrate
  promising performance of the new approach.
