title: Stick-breaking Construction for the Indian Buffet Process
abstract: The Indian buffet process (IBP) is a Bayesian nonparametric distribution
  whereby objects are modelled using an unbounded number of latent features. In this
  paper we derive a stick-breaking representation for the IBP. Based on this new representation,
  we develop slice samplers for the IBP that are efficient, easy to implement and
  are more generally applicable than the currently available Gibbs sampler. This representation,
  along with the work of Thibaux and Jordan [17], also illuminates interesting theoretical
  connections between the IBP, Chinese restaurant processes, Beta processes and Dirichlet
  processes.
