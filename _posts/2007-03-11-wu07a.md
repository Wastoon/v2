title: Transductive Classification via Local Learning Regularization
abstract: The idea of local learning, classifying a particular point based on its
  neighbors, has been successfully applied to supervised learning problems. In this
  paper, we adapt it for Transductive Classification (TC) problems. Specifically,
  we formulate a Local Learning Regularizer (LL-Reg) which leads to a solution with
  the property that the label of each data point can be well predicted based on its
  neighbors and their labels. For model selection, an efficient way to compute the
  leave-one-out classification error is provided for the proposed and related algorithms.
  Experimental results using several benchmark datasets illustrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed approach.
