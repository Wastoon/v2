<h3>Abstract</h3>

We consider the problem of component selection in a functional ANOVA model. A nonparametric extension of the nonnegative garrote (Breiman, 1996) is proposed. We show that the whole solution path of the proposed method can be efficiently computed, which, in turn , facilitates the selection of the tuning parameter. We also show that the final estimate enjoys nice theoretical properties given that the tuning parameter is appropriately chosen. Simulation and a real data example demonstrate promising performance of the new approach.
