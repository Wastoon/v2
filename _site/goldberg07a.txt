<h3>Abstract</h3>

Label dissimilarity specifies that a pair of examples probably have different class labels. We present a semi-supervised classification algorithm that learns from dissimilarity and similarity information on labeled and unlabeled data. Our approach uses a novel graphbased encoding of dissimilarity that results in a convex problem, and can handle both binary and multiclass classification. Experiments on several tasks are promising.
