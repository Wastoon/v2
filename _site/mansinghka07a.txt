<h3>Abstract</h3>

We present AClass, a simple, online, parallelizable algorithm for supervised multiclass classification. AClass models each classconditional density as a Chinese restaurant process mixture, and performs approximate inference in this model using a sequential Monte Carlo scheme. AClass combines several strengths of previous approaches to classification that are not typically found in a single algorithm; it supports learning from missing data and yields sensibly regularized nonlinear decision boundaries while remaining computationally efficient. We compare AClass to several standard classification algorithms and show competitive performance.
